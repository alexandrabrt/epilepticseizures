# Forecasting epileptic seizures

This repository contains the accompanying materials for the Applied Machine Learning Days 2021 (AMLD) workshop ["Forecasting epileptic seizures"](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-epfl-2021/workshops/forecasting-epileptic-seizures).

The goal of the workshop was to develop models based on brain activity monitored by EEG to forecast upcoming periods of heightened seizure risk in patients with epilepsy. The workshop used a dataset of 18 patients, each with more than two years of continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings obtained via an intracranially implanted recording device (a sort of pacemaker for the brain).

My motivation was to learn how signal type of data can be modelled probabilistically.

The notebooks aren't mine and are taken from the workshop itself.
